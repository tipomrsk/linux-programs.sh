Simple script for installing packages that I usually use on my systems.
Since I've been into "Distro Hopping" lately, installing packages over and over again is quite a hassle and very tiresome. So, to make things easier, I ended up creating this script a few days ago during one late night.



## Packages

 - [Flatpak]()
 - [Gnome Tweaks]()
 - [Docker]()
 - [Docker Compose]()
 - [ZSH]()
 - [Spotify]()
 - [Discord]()
 - [Telegram]()
 - [VLC]()
 - [VSCode]()
 - [BeeKeeper]()
 - [Postman]()
 - [Google Chrome]()
 - [FlameShot]()

 


## Running

Just execute:

```bash
  sudo bash script.sh [--manjaro|--ubuntu|--fedora]
```





## More Packages?

I might add more in the future. But if you want, you can clone or fork it and modify the `applications` array; it's pretty self-explanatory.
```
[PACKAGE_NAME]="FLATHUB_PACKAGE_ID"
```
